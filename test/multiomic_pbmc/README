Use the makefile to download test data from the public part of our
in lab server. The fullsize test data is too big for github.

The .sh scripts in here shows how the test data was produced.
(ToDo; this is not reproducible since done with local files on our computer)

The .py scripts tests different parts of the scherlock suite.


NOTE: Would not be surprised if most of this is broken now since there have
      been substantial changes to scherlock
