Use the makefile to download test data from the public part of our
in lab server. It also generates sizes.chromosome

make_cellpile.sh makes cellpiles from the test data.

The other .sh and .py scripts in here tests different parts of scherlock.
The .ipynbs are Jupyter notebooks doing things similar to the .py scripts.

The only parts of the test suite that are recently tested and updated are the
cellpile parts. Updated 2021-07-09

ToDo: - The fullsize test data cannot be reproduced using this scripts here
      - Better solution would be to provide download links and scripts to
        reproduce also the fullsize test data, so that users can know its
        origins.
