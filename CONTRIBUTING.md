Contributing
============

Contributions to SCherlock are highly welcome! A few bug reports go a long way already

Before filing an issue
----------------------
* Search the repository (also google) to see if someone has already reported the same issue.
  This allows contributors to spend less time responding to issues, and more time adding new features!
* Please provide a minimal complete verifiable example for any bug.
  If you're not sure what this means, check out

* Let us know about your environment. Environment information is available via: `sc.logging.print_versions()`.

Contributing code
-----------------

We're taking! However, please first spend a little time ensuring basic code quality:
* Do all functions have proper comments?
* Is the code commented such that documentation will be properly generated?
* Are the functions designed in a way that make their use somewhat obvious?
* Does your code rely on anything that has a good chance of breaking?
